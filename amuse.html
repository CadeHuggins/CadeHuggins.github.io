      America's Funniest Home Videos featured a segment in which viewers were invited to send in video clips from their home movies; 
       Contestants can submit their videos by uploading them, the majority of the video clips are short (5â€“30 seconds) and are mostly related to the host's monologues.

      and practical jokes.
