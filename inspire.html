    <h2>Comic book Superman</h2>
    <p>Since 1938, Superman stories have been regularly published in periodical comic books published by DC Comics. 
      The first and oldest of these is Action Comics, which began in April 1938.[1] Action Comics was initially an anthology magazine, but it eventually became dedicated to Superman stories. 
      The second oldest periodical is Superman, which began in June 1939. Action Comics and Superman have been published without interruption (ignoring changes to the title and numbering scheme).
      Several other shorter-lived Superman periodicals have been published over the years.[73] Superman is part of the DC Universe, which is a shared setting of superhero characters owned by DC Comics, 
      and consequently he frequently appears in stories alongside the likes of Batman, Wonder Woman, and others.
